              <h2>In the assignment brief I was asked to make a simple website but regardless of this I still made sure it was done to a good standard. I was required to demonstrate my programming skills using the languages HTML5 and CSS.Before starting the website, I made sure I designed my website using sketches as shown below:</h2>
              <p></p>
              <h2>Home page sketch
              <img src="home page.jpg" alt="home sketch"></h2>

              <h2>Glossary page sketch
              <img src="glossary page.jpg" alt="glossary sketch"></h2>

              <h2>Comparison page sketch
              <img src="comparison page.jpg" alt="comparison sketch"></h2>

              <h2>Resources page sketch
              <img src="resources page.jpg" alt="resources sketch"></h2>

              <h2>MGP page sketch
              <img src="mgp page.jpg" alt="mgp sketch"></h2>

              <h2>Reflection page sketch
              <img src="reflection page.jpg" alt="reflection sketch"></h2>
                
              This was done to make the production of this website much easier as I already had an idea of what the website would look like. To start the actual creation of the website I went on website and looked at a range of tutorials to give me an idea of how to make a HTML website. I also researched some example of websites that have a good User Interface Design. After all of this I had a pretty firm idea of what to do, so making the main layout of the website didn't take very long. After that I then made the website look more professional by styling it in CSS. This required me to do further research about with the aim to familiarize myself with common CSS commands which I didn’t really find too difficult as i have had experience with it in the past. With this knowledge, I could start styling my website to make it look more professional and much prettier. To save time I made the 6 pages identical at first so that the styling could be used on all pages, rather than styling each page individually. This also made the design of the website consistent. From there I then edited the data for each page according to the assignment brief.

              To further meet the requirements in the assignment i used photoshop to optimize all my images, below are 2 examples of me doing this:
              <p></p>
              <h2><img src="optimized.JPG" alt="optiimzed image 1"></h2>

              <h1><img src="optimized 2.jpg" alt="optiimzed image 2"></h2>
            
              Finally i made my code live by cloning my repository as shown below:
              <p></p>
              <img src="live code 2.JPG" alt="live code screenshot2">
              <p></p>
              <img src="live-code.JPG" alt="live code screenshot">
            </h2>
                
            </ul>

            
        </div>
      
        <div class="content4">
        
          <ul><h2><a href="#top">BACK TO TOP</a></h2></ul>

        </div>
        
            </div>
                <footer id="myFooter6">
