      <h2> Below is a comparative essay on 2 developer jobs that i found on a website called CWJOBS.COM </h2>

                <h3>
                    The 2 Job titles I will be comparing are “Lead Game Developer” and “Junior Web Developer”. 
                    <p></p>  
                    In both Job titles, they have already given an insight of the kind of skills the companies are looking for. Next to the "Lead Game Developer" job title, it says C#, C++ and Unity. These are all programming languages so immediately the applicant would know that he/she needs to have programming experience. Simillarly the “Junior Web Developer” job title also displays some programming languages (PHP and MYSQL), however unlike the Game Job this job requires you to have knowledge of something other than a programming language which is Ubuntu, a customizable GUI (Graphical User Interface); It is also a distribution of Linux (An open-source Operating System). 
                    <p></p>
                    Another similarity that these 2 job titles have is that they do not require a university degree. From my research this is quite a common occurrence which implies that companies prefer experience over a degree.
                    <p></p>
                    In terms of salary The Games job is more lucrative as the starting salary is £20,000 per annum whereas the Web job is £18,000 per annum. This shows that the gaming industry is making a lot more money than the Web developing history and this makese sense as there aren't just game applications, there also gaming websites and consoles, which cost a lot of money to buy and sell therefore bringing a lot profit into the industry.
                    <p></p>
                    From my research, it seems like the Web job requires a few more technical skills than the Games job. The Games job requires the following skills:
                    <ol> C# - programming language </ol>
                    <ol> C++ - programming language </ol>
                    <ol> Unity - programming language </ol>
                    On the other hand the Web job had the following technical skills:
                    <ol> Comprehensive knowledge of PHP - programming language </ol>
                    <ol>	Good knowledge of MySQL - programming language </ol>
                    <ol> Familiarity of working in an Ubuntu environment - knowledge of the Ubuntu operating system</ol>
                    <ol>	Experience with HTML & CSS - programming languages </ol>
                    <ol>	Experience with jQuery & JavaScript - programming languages </ol>
                    So as you can see the Web job requires more technical skills. However, the Games job has more non-technical/personal skills.
                    The Games job :
                    <ol> Strategic thinking </ol>
                    <ol> Leaderships Skills </ol>
                    <ol> Being able to execute projects on time to good standard </ol>
                    <p></p>
                    To conclude, Both of these jobs are quite professional in their requirements. I say this because in another job i looked at before i found these 2 jobs, one of the unique unexpected requirements was that you needed to have a sense of humour. This really surprised me as it's not the kind of thing you'd think of straight away but it would make the work environment more friendly and comfortable.
